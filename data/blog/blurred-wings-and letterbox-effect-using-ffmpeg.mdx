### What is a letterbox/pillarbox?

Suppose you have a video which does not fit your viewport, you end up having blackbars either at top and bottom, or left and right.

<Image
  width={439}
  height={572}
  layout="intrinsic"
  src="/img/blog/blurred-wings-and letterbox-effect-using-ffmpeg/diag.png"
/>

or perhaps...

So lets try to add blurred background from the video to fill in the letterbox/pillarbox. We can do this in 2 ways.

1. The CSS way.
2. The FFMPEG way.

### The CSS way

We can create a duplicate video element with upscaled video which fits the viewport, add a `div` over it and blur the `div`, and use it as the background for our original video element.

But before we call it a day, taken directly from [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/animated-blur#tldr),

> Animating a blur is not really an option as it is very slow. Instead, pre-compute a series of increasingly blurred versions and cross-fade between them.

Welp, we aren't clearly "animating" a blur effect, but we are blurring a portion of the screen with video playing. Which IS an expensive filter. Not to mention the limitation of the API. We will not enjoy the features of modern CSS in Android or iOS runtime. Which is why processing the video using FFMPEG beforehand is the way to go for most of the cases.
