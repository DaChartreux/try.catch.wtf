### Theme toggle

A theme toggle might sound very trivial at first. What could go wrong with switching themes? _A lot_, things start to get serious. So let's dive right into how to toggle themes in SSR. I will be using Next.js and Emotion, but this can also be applied to any SSR framework using either CSS-in-JS or CSS to style the app.

```bash
yarn create next-app theme-toggle
```

```bash
$ yarn add @emotion/styled @emotion/react
```

```jsx
>>> _app.js

import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const Container = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  padding-top: 35vh;
`;

export default function Home: any() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <main>
        <h1>Next.js dark mode toggle</h1>
        <h4>Dark mode is more than just a gimmick, right?!</h4>
      </main>
    </Container>
  );
}
```
